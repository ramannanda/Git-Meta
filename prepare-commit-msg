# prepare-commit-msg
# This hook will extract meta info from the system and push
# it as a comment in the commit
#
#
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "prepare-commit-msg".
#

# prepare-commit-msg
# This hook is invoked by git-commit[1] right after preparing the default log message, and before the editor is started.

# It takes one to three parameters.
# The first is the name of the file that contains the commit log message.
# The second is the source of the commit message,
#	and can be: message (if a -m or -F option was given);
#	template (if a -t option was given or the configuration option commit.template is set);
#	merge (if the commit is a merge or a .git/MERGE_MSG file exists);
#	squash (if a .git/SQUASH_MSG file exists);
#	or commit,
# followed by a commit SHA-1 (if a -c, -C or --amend option was given).

# If the exit status is non-zero, git commit will abort.

# The purpose of the hook is to edit the message file in place, and it is not suppressed by the --no-verify option. A non-zero exit means a failure of the hook and aborts the commit. It should not be used as replacement for pre-commit hook.

# The sample prepare-commit-msg hook that comes with Git removes the help message found in the commented portion of the commit template.
